            I work on the Salesforce IoT Cloud, a massively scalable event processing engine for realtime engagement and analytics. My main focus is that design and implement clusters provision and management for IoT cloud. 1. Provision and manage AWS and Heroku resource, heavily involving Cloudformation, EC2, Auto-scaling and ELB, etc.2. Deploy micro-services, manage versioning, upgrading IoT platform properly, scale up and scale down micro-services when necessary. Micro-services that we support use Kafka, Storm, Spark, Cassandra, Kubernetes and so on. 3. Find the best practice to store sensitive and critical information, for example, auth token, client secret. 4. Customize platform when business needs dynamically, involving database migration, kafka migration, Cloudformation infrastructure update. We are now co-hosting workloads across 10K customers, batch transforming ~100MM rows of user data daily and real-time ingests 7 TB of events daily, ~80 MB/s sustained.
