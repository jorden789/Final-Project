        Personal Information
      
        
        I actively participate and engage with organisations board, community
members and advise them in formulating new projects and brainstorm best ways to achieve
desired goals.
By being active in this organisation, I was able to meet and connect with people from various
walks of life. It has helped me learn, better understand us as human being, identify the
bottleneck of first generation immigrants.
By learning about their problems, I have to come to understand that regardless of ones
background people have different and unique approach and methods in solving similar
problems, their desire to succeed, their fear of unknowns. It is one of the most humbling
experience that made me who I am in terms of social activism, our common struggle for
opportunities.
