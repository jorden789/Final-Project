     switches. Used dual fiver connection in a port-channel vpc configuration between
     the 2 7k core switches. All the access layers switches were 3850's coming
     back to 7k core in a dual port channel configuration with primary and
     secondary connections to the pri/sec 7k cores.
 For core offices builds I used
     nexus 9k as core layer switch for all SVI interfaces and vpc port channel
     configurations with the access layer switches in the idfs. Used 9k in an
