 qualcomm － santa clara, ca
 led board bring-ups for upcoming smart devices that contain qualcomm 4g lte chipsets constrained by extremely tiny form-factor. developed proprietary single antenna lte solution.  (2015, 2016)developed algorithms that have helped significantly reduce power consumption on receiver amplifiers during 4g lte micro-sleep states. saving current of 15 ma per amp. the algorithms run in time-constrained receiver automatic gain control timeline, ensuring signal level changes are 3gpp compliant and take place under a mili-second. resolved multiple feature interaction issues with assembly level debug of mipi scripts that are programmed by arm cortex m. (2015, 2016)provided configurable tx duty cycle for factory test mode lte, helped cut customer operations costs by eliminating need for expensive test equipment (2015)led development of "dynamic auto rf path selection algorithms" that enabled world-mode aka international roaming 4g lte advanced carrier aggregation that could support multiple rf frontend combinations on the same smartphone. used c inheritance concept to abstract device details from lte firmware. improved sensitivity and accuracy by up to 4 dbs. got promoted for introduction and successful commercialization of lte and lte carrier aggregation on key design wins for qualcomm (2014)    developed 4g and 3g transmitter dac calibration and configuration drivers that helped save 100s of microseconds of warm up time during packet transmissions. delved into mixed-signal register sequences, executing in minimum amount of cycles to save boot time (2013)introduced lte on a very sought after tablet\'s cellular variant. working in a very small team, did ground floor work, debugging, improving all aspects of rf through factory evt, dvt, pvt (2011, 2012)developed algorithms that use on-chip transceiver power detector(hdet) for lte max power limiting(mtpl). developed isrs for a strict, micro-second level timeline (2012)developed factory test mode capability for transmitting cw tone in lte bands. enabled characterization of tx frequency response over the entire bandwidth, saving equipment costs and technician time otherwise needed with conventional rf analysis. (2012)developed average power tracking (apt) proof of concept for power amplifiers. developed microsecond level execution time constrained embedded software in c for linear interpolation of data-points from transmitter power measurements, and low-level programming of dc-dc converters aka smps for power amplifiers. apt saved over 30% of battery and is used in 90% of all mobile devices (2010, 2011)provided many improvements to modem adc clock sourcing and switching for spur mitigation in cdma gps. improved gps receiver sensitivity significantly. used fixed-point math for calculating spurs and transceiver pll programming codes. got promoted for expert level jtag debug of multiple rf frontend issues.  (2010)driver development for single chip modem rf transceiver cdma implementation. used c for encapsulating transceiver key features. provided a proof of concept for re-purposing wcdma transceiver for cdma usage, delving into low-level asic blocks. this enabled a china customer for faster time-to-market (2009)fine-tuned and mainlined a dormant algorithm design for supporting cdma receiver diversity dynamic switching for multi-antenna devices. simulated the iir filters in matlab. provided corrections to fixed point c arithmetic. algorithm improves battery life significantly while improving voice quality (2008)as a systems engineer, provided multiple improvements to cdma is98 compliance standard test sequences, catching multiple field issues during lab prototype tests thus avoiding device returns. evaluated potential standard improvements, got promoted for significantly altering compliance test approaches (2006, 2007)​

 publications
 us patent us8594121 b2patent title "cognitive radio spectrum sensor employing peak-to-average ratio as the signal feature"inventors: sushant thakur (primary), saidhiraj amuru, vollala cabstract: a white space sensing method includes measuring a peak to average power ratio (papr) of a signal of a channel in a spectrum band. the method also includes determining whether a ratio of the measured  papr to a predetermined  papr of a modulation scheme associated with the signal meets a predetermined threshold. the method further includes indicating the channel is available for use by an unlicensed user when the ratio meets the predetermined threshold
